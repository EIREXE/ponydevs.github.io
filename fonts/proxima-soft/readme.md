# [Proxima Nova Soft by Mark Simonson](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Abril+Fatface)

Proxima Nova Soft (2011) is a rounded version of Proxima Nova. It was designed to be used on the MyFonts website. It has been specially optimized for web use. After getting many requests and queries about it, I made it available for purchase through all my usual font sellers. It doesnâ€™t yet have all the weights and styles of Proxima Nova, or its extensive language support, but I intend to add those features as soon as I can.
